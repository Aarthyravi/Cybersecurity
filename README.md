I am passionate about my current job that gives an opportunity for identifying / detecting the issuses, raise the defects and report it to the respective DEV team accordingly. Having Analytical skill set that helps to react very quickly during PROD Live testing. So I can handle the real time threats and risks according to the Organization's process and Protocol.

applications, data & networks from the security threats & risks. Definitely I can contribute my skills to the security team in order to mitigate the risks after completing my Google cybersercurity certification.
